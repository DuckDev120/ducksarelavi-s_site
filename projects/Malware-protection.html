            <h2>About Malware Protection</h2>
            <p>
In this project, I worked on a theoretical malware simulation for learning purposes, alongside developing a defensive system designed to monitor and prevent its activity. I started by implementing code that simulates attack-like behavior at a logical level, such as information collection, communication flows, and system-level actions. In parallel, I designed and built a monitoring and prevention layer that detects anomalous patterns and attempts to block them at runtime.

All development was done in Python, using libraries such as Scapy and Pylibnet for network traffic analysis and packet manipulation, and Cryptography for handling encryption and analyzing secure data flows. During the process, I built a monitoring system that included logging, process and behavior tracking, and comparisons between expected and suspicious activity. I iteratively improved the detection logic until I reached a point where the system was able to successfully identify the simulated attack and prevent it from continuing.

This project required working on both the offensive and defensive perspectives, dealing with lower-level system behavior, and solving problems related to data flow, stability, and performance. It significantly strengthened my understanding of cybersecurity concepts, network communication, and writing structured, modular Python code.
